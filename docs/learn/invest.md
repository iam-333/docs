## 2. Create a Qubic Wallet

Regardless of how you choose to invest, you'll need a Qubic wallet to store your $QUBIC:

1. Create a seed: This is a 55-character lowercase string that acts as your password. For example: `lcehvbvddggkjfnokduyjuiyvkklrvrmsaozwbvjlzvgvfipqpnkkuf`

   :::caution
   Never share your seed with anyone. If you lose it, you lose your $QUBIC.
   :::

2. Get your Qubic ID: This is a 60-character string derived from your seed. You can obtain it by adding your seed to the [qubic.li wallet](https://wallet.qubic.li/).

3. Use the [qubic.li wallet](https://wallet.qubic.li/) to manage your $QUBIC: Create a vault and add your seed to interact with Qubic.

   :::note
