## Quottery in a Nutshell

 - Scarcity Mechanism: Each bet burns 2% of the total QU used, further reducing the circulating supply and benefiting QU holders. 
 - First-Mover Advantage: Quottery stands as the first decentralised betting platform in the Qubic ecosystem, though it remains open for future competitors pending Quorum approval.

This fee is set by Computors and regulated by the Quorum, ensuring secure and fair bet processing. 

## Betting Service Fee

A 3% service fee applies to all winning bets, supporting the operation and maintenance of the platform. 

## Burning Fee

For every bet, 2% of the total amount staked in QU is burned, reducing the circulating supply and benefiting the ecosystem.

## Asset Transfer Fee
A fixed QU fee applies to asset transfers, ensuring minimal friction in moving assets between accounts. 

## Storage Fees
Bets and assets on Quottery require storage on the Qubic network. The smart contracts cover storage fees, ensuring users aren’t charged for network maintenance. 

## Looking Ahead

As Quottery continues to develop, additional features and betting options will be introduced, enhancing the user experience and ensuring a sustainable, decentralised ecosystem. Future updates will provide even more functionality, aiming to position Quottery as an essential part of the Qubic ecosystem.
